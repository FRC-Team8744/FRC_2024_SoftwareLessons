# Lesson 9: Merging GitHub code  11/28/2023

## Review from before vacation
Where did we leave things?  Oh yes, we tried to upload our branches to GitHub and everyone's computers complained that Git was not completely set up.  Guess what - that was just a warning!  Everyone's branch was actually uploaded to GitHub (except for those people that forgot their passwords!).

## Today's goals
Learning how to share and merge code will be essential after the new game kickoff, so we are going to continue adding functions to Thomas.

## VSCode / GitHub review
Just a quick mention of what went wrong last meeting.  Git expects each user that submits code to have a default email address and user name defined - so that if someone submits something offtrack an administrator can locate them.  We have a small group and GitHub requires you to log in, so that doesn't apply too much to us.

## Work on this:
* If you did not create a new branch last time, open up [lesson 8](./Lesson08.md) and pick something to add to Thomas.
* Did you upload your branch?  Check your Source Control tab to see if you need to log back into GitHub and publish your changes.
* Does your code work?  If not start debugging it and asking questions!
* Do you want to try something else?  Feel free to go back to [lesson 8](./Lesson08.md) and try adding something to your branch.

## Merging
* You will each take turns merging your code into the "Alex" branch using the drivestation computer with the projector.  We will NOT be merging anything into Main.

### Where we go from here
What do we still need to learn about before Kickoff?

* Swerve drive
* Autonomous command groups
* Visual servo
